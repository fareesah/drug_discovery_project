# Drug Discovery Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to discover bioactive molecules, including a generative VAE model for molecule generation and a binding affinity predictor.

## Project Structure
- `models/`: Contains model definitions for VAE and Affinity Predictor.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for training VAE and affinity predictor models.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for data handling.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Train the models:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
